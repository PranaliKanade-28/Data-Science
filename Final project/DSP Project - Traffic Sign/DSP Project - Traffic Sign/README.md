# Traffic-Sign-Classification

We built 2 basic CNN models for recognizing traffic road signs in an image which can be used to train a self-driving car or help drivers become more alert of the road signs ahead.

***Model 1:*** 
Classifying the road sign as stop and non-stop (Execute - 2. Binary classification.ipynb file)

***Model 2:*** 
Classifying the road sign as a category - warning, regulatory and stop. (Execute - 2. Multi class classification .ipynb file)
